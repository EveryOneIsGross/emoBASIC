## emoBASIC - Hand Gesture Emoji Programming Language
Welcome to emoBASIC, a unique and expressive programming language that utilizes hand gesture emojis to write code. With emoBASIC, you can explore the world of programming in an engaging and visually intuitive way. This language simplifies syntax by replacing traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it accessible to beginners and fun for experienced programmers.

##Features

Expressive Syntax: Communicate your code's intent through hand gesture emojis, representing variables, loops, conditionals, and more.
Visual Programming: Embrace a multidimensional programming experience by utilizing hand direction emojis to guide the flow of your code.
Simple and Intuitive: Simplify complex programming concepts with a minimalistic approach, focusing on essential operations and structures.
Expandable and Customizable: Build upon the existing set of emojis and define your own functions and commands within the language.

Introduction
This language provides a new way of visualizing programming concepts. It's designed to be minimalistic, replacing the complex syntax with simple, intuitive symbols. The unique aspect of this language is the code's flow, guided by hand direction emojis, which results in a multidimensional structure.

While it's a creative and interesting way of introducing programming concepts, this language, due to its abstract nature, might pose challenges for complex programming tasks. It's an excellent tool for education and conceptual understanding, making programming an accessible and fun activity.

Emoji Glossary
Each hand emoji in the language represents a specific command or operation:
'''
🤙 (Call me hand): START (Beginning of a program)
👋 (Waving hand): PRINT (Outputs data to the console)
🖐️ (Raised hand): INPUT (Used to receive user input)
✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END (Terminates a program)
🤚 (Raised back of hand): RETURN (Returns a value from a function)
✊ (Raised fist): Variable (Used to represent variables in the language)
👊 (Oncoming fist): 0 (Binary representation)
🤛 (Left-facing fist): IF (Start of an IF condition block)
🤜 (Right-facing fist): THEN (Start of a THEN action block)
🙌 (Raising hands): LOOP (Start of a LOOP block)
👏 (Clapping hands): REPEAT (Repeatedly execute a block of code)
🙏 (Folded hands): Function (Defines a function)
👌 (OK hand): LET (Used to assign values to variables)
👍 (Thumbs up): Increment (Increases the value of a variable by 1)
👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement (Decreases the value of a variable by 1)
👈 (Backhand index pointing left): GOTO previous line
👉 (Backhand index pointing right): GOTO next line
👆 (Backhand index pointing up): GOTO the line above
👇 (Backhand index pointing down): GOTO the line below
🖖 (Vulcan salute): Quotation (Starts or ends a string of text)
🤞 (Crossed fingers): AND (Logical AND operator)
🤟 (Love-you gesture): OR (Logical OR operator)
🤘 (Sign of the horns): NOT (Logical NOT operator)
🤲 (Palms up together): , (Comma)
✌️ (Victory hand): LESS THAN operator
🤟 (I love you hand sign): MORE THAN operator
👌 (OK Hand): EQUAL TO operator
'''
Variables: Variables can be represented by a hand gesture emoji, such as ✊. To assign a value to a variable, you can use the 👌 emoji followed by the variable and the value. For example: 👌 ✊ ☝️ assigns the value 1 to the variable ✊.

Print Output: To print output, you can use the 👋 emoji followed by the variable or value you want to print. For example: 👋 ✊ prints the value of the variable ✊.

Conditionals: Conditionals can be expressed using the 🤛 (Left-facing fist) and 🤜 (Right-facing fist) emojis. For example:

'''
🤛 ✊ ✌️ ✊ 🤜 👋 ✊
'''
This represents an IF statement where the condition compares the values of two variables (✊ and ✌️). If they are equal, it will execute the following line which prints the value of ✊.

Loops: Loops can be created using the 🙌 (Raising hands) emoji. For example:

'''
🙌
👌 ✊ ☝️
👋 ✊
🙌
'''
This represents a loop that assigns the value 1 to the variable ✊ and prints its value indefinitely.

Arithmetic Operations: For arithmetic operations, you can use the variable symbols and combine them with the desired operation emoji. For example:

'''
👌 ✊ ☝️
👌 ✌️ 🤟 ✊
👋 ✊
'''
This assigns the sum of the values of ✊ and ✌️ to ✊ and then prints its value.

This syntax provides a basic structure for working with variables, conditionals, loops, and arithmetic operations. 

'''
🤙
👋 🖖 Hello, World!
✋
'''

This code uses the 👋 (Waving hand) emoji to print the string "Hello, World!" enclosed in 🖖 (Vulcan salute) emojis.
