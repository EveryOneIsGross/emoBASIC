## emoBASIC - an Emoji-only Programming Language

Welcome to emoBASIC, a unique and expressive programming language that utilizes hand gesture emojis to write code. With emoBASIC, you can explore the world of programming in an engaging and visually intuitive way. This language simplifies syntax by replacing traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it accessible to beginners and fun for experienced programmers. 

## Features

emoBASIC is a unique, expressive, and intuitive programming language that leverages the power of hand gesture emojis to write code. It replaces traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it not only accessible to beginners but also enjoyable for experienced programmers.

The language embraces a multidimensional programming experience, using hand direction emojis to guide the flow of the code. This results in a unique multidimensional structure and format guide that adds a visual dimension to programming.

With a focus on simplifying complex programming concepts, emoBASIC adopts a minimalistic approach. It concentrates on essential operations and structures, making it easier for users to understand and use.

Despite its simplicity, emoBASIC is expandable and customizable. Users can build with the existing set of emojis and define their own functions and commands within the language.

While emoBASIC supports single-digit addition and subtraction per function. This design choice is to ensure the language can be understood quickly and to simplify logic systems for conversational use with humans.

In emoBASIC, numbers are stored as variables using binary representation, and no emoji strings are allowed as variables for readability. The language also uses directional emoji as wait logic, creating delays or pauses in the code execution based on each character as a unit of time.

In summary, emoBASIC is a simple, intuitive, and expressive programming language that uses emojis to make coding more accessible and fun.

Emoji Glossary
Each hand emoji in the language represents a specific command or operation:
```
🤙 (Call me hand): START (Beginning of a program)
👋 (Waving hand): PRINT (Outputs data to the console)
🖐️ (Raised hand): INPUT (Used to receive user input)
✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END (Terminates a program)
🤚 (Raised back of hand): RETURN (Returns a value from a function)
✊ (Raised fist): Variable (Used to represent variables in the language)
👊 (Oncoming fist): 0 (Binary representation)
☝️ (One raised finger): 1 (Binary representation)
🙏 (Folded hands): Function (Defines a function)
👍 (Thumbs up): Increment (Increases the value of a variable by 1)
👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement (Decreases the value of a variable by 1)
👈 (Backhand index pointing left): Move to the previous command in the current line
👉 (Backhand index pointing right): Move to the next command in the current line
👆 (Backhand index pointing up): Move to the same command in the previous line
👇 (Backhand index pointing down): Move to the same command in the next line
🤛 (Left-facing fist): LESS THAN operator
🤜 (Right-facing fist): MORE THAN operator
🖖 (Vulcan salute): EQUAL TO operator
🤞 (Crossed fingers): AND (Logical AND operator)
🤟 (Love-you gesture): OR (Logical OR operator)
🤘 (Sign of the horns): NOT (Logical NOT operator)
👌 (OK hand): Assignment operator (Assigns a value to a variable)
```
With these emojis, you can create a multidimensional grid of commands and navigate through them using the directional hand emojis. This adds a new dimension to your programming language and makes it even more unique and engaging.

The directional emojis 👈, 👉, 👆, and 👇 are used to navigate through the code.

Alright, let's update the examples according to the changes:

**Example 1:**
```
🤙
👋 Hello, World
✋
```
Explanation of the code:

The program starts with 🤙 (START). The 👋 (Waving hand) emoji is used to print the text "Hello, World". The program ends with ✋ (END). When executed, this program will output: Hello, World

**Example 2:**
```
🤙
👌 ✊ ☝️👊
👍 ✊
🤛 ✊ 🤜 ☝️👊
👋 ✊
✋
```
In this program, we're assigning the binary value 10 (☝️👊, which is 2 in decimal) to the variable ✊. Then, we increment the variable ✊ with 👍. After that, we're checking if the value of ✊ is less than 2 (☝️👊), and if it is, we're printing the value of ✊.

**Communicating in person with emoBASIC**

You: 🤙 (Start)

You: 👌 ✊ ☝️👊 (Assign binary 10 to variable ✊)

You: 👍 ✊ (Increment variable ✊)

You: 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ☝️👊 (If ✊ is less than 2)

You: 👋 ✊ (Print ✊)

You: ✋ (End)

In this conversation, you're using hand gestures to communicate the same program. You start the program with the 🤙 gesture, assign a value to the variable with 👌 ✊ ☝️👊, increment the variable with 👍 ✊, check if ✊ is less than 2 with 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ☝️👊, print ✊ with 👋 ✊, and end the program with ✋.

IRL emoBASIC opens up a whole new world of possibilities for visual, non-verbal communication about programming and logic. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, you can use IRL emoBASIC to make your conversations more engaging and visually intuitive.
