## emoBASIC - xyDirectional Emoji Programming Language

Welcome to emoBASIC, a unique and expressive programming language that utilizes hand gesture emojis to write code. With emoBASIC, you can explore the world of programming in an engaging and visually intuitive way. This language simplifies syntax by replacing traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it accessible to beginners and fun for experienced programmers. The unique aspect of this language is the code's flow, guided by hand direction emojis, which results in a multidimensional structure.

## Features

Expressive Syntax: Communicate your code's intent through hand gesture emojis, representing variables, loops, conditionals, and more.
Visual Programming: Embrace a multidimensional programming experience by utilizing hand direction emojis to guide the flow of your code.
Simple and Intuitive: Simplify complex programming concepts with a minimalistic approach, focusing on essential operations and structures.
Expandable and Customizable: Build upon the existing set of emojis and define your own functions and commands within the language.


Emoji Glossary
Each hand emoji in the language represents a specific command or operation:
```
🤙 (Call me hand): START (Beginning of a program)
👋 (Waving hand): PRINT (Outputs data to the console)
🖐️ (Raised hand): INPUT (Used to receive user input)
✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END (Terminates a program)
🤚 (Raised back of hand): RETURN (Returns a value from a function)
✊ (Raised fist): Variable (Used to represent variables in the language)
👊 (Oncoming fist): 0 (Binary representation)
☝️ (One raised finger): 1 (Binary representation)
🙏 (Folded hands): Function (Defines a function)
👍 (Thumbs up): Increment (Increases the value of a variable by 1)
👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement (Decreases the value of a variable by 1)
👈 (Backhand index pointing left): Move to the previous command in the current line
👉 (Backhand index pointing right): Move to the next command in the current line
👆 (Backhand index pointing up): Move to the same command in the previous line
👇 (Backhand index pointing down): Move to the same command in the next line
🤛 (Left-facing fist): LESS THAN operator
🤜 (Right-facing fist): MORE THAN operator
🖖 (Vulcan salute): EQUAL TO operator
🤞 (Crossed fingers): AND (Logical AND operator)
🤟 (Love-you gesture): OR (Logical OR operator)
🤘 (Sign of the horns): NOT (Logical NOT operator)
🤲 (Palms up together): , (Comma)
👌 (OK hand): Assignment operator (Assigns a value to a variable)
✌️ (Victory Hand): Variable State (Used to represent a specific state of a variable)
```
With these emojis, you can create a multidimensional grid of commands and navigate through them using the directional hand emojis. This adds a new dimension to your programming language and makes it even more unique and engaging.

The directional emojis 👈, 👉, 👆, and 👇 are used to navigate through the code.

```
✌️Hello, World
🤙🤙
👋 ✌️
✋
```
Explanation of the code:

The program starts with 🤙 (START).
The 👋 (Waving hand) emoji is used to print the text "Hello, World" preceded by ✌️.
The program ends with ✋ (END).
When executed, this program will output:
Hello, World

Line Length Control in emoBASIC
In emoBASIC, you have the ability to define the maximum line length at the start of your program. This is done by writing the START command (🤙) a certain number of times. For example, if you write 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙 at the beginning of your program, you are setting the maximum line length to 5 characters.

This feature is designed to keep your code concise and manageable. Any characters beyond the defined line length will be treated as comments and will not be executed as part of the program. This allows you to add notes and explanations directly in your code without affecting the program's operation.

emoBASIC:

```
🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
👌 ✊ ☝️👊
👌 ✌️ ☝️
🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️
👋 ✊
✋
```
In this program, we're assigning the binary value 10 (☝️👊, which is 2 in decimal) to the variable ✊ and the value 1 (☝️) to the variable ✌️. Then we're checking if the value of ✊ is less than ✌️, and if it is, we're printing the value of ✊.

In IRLemoBASIC, the conversation would go like this:

IRLemoBASIC:

```
You: 🤙 (Start)
You: 👌 ✊ ☝️👊 (Assign binary 10 to variable ✊)
You: 👌 ✌️ ☝️ (Assign 1 to variable ✌️)
You: 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️ (If ✊ is less than ✌️)
You: 👋 ✊ (Print ✊)
You: ✋ (End)
```
In this conversation, you're using hand gestures to communicate the same program. You start the program with the 🤙 gesture, assign values to the variables with 👌 ✊ ☝️👊 and 👌 ✌️ ☝️, check if ✊ is less than ✌️ with 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️, print ✊ with 👋 ✊, and end the program with ✋.

IRL emoBASIC opens up a whole new world of possibilities for visual, non-verbal communication about programming and logic. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, you can use IRL emoBASIC to make your conversations more engaging and visually intuitive.
