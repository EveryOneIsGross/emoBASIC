## emoBASIC - xyDirectional Emoji Programming Language

Welcome to emoBASIC, a unique and expressive programming language that utilizes hand gesture emojis to write code. With emoBASIC, you can explore the world of programming in an engaging and visually intuitive way. This language simplifies syntax by replacing traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it accessible to beginners and fun for experienced programmers. The unique aspect of this language is the code's flow, guided by hand direction emojis, which results in a multidimensional structure.

## Features

Expressive Syntax: Communicate your code's intent through hand gesture emojis, representing variables, loops, conditionals, and more.
Visual Programming: Embrace a multidimensional programming experience by utilizing hand direction emojis to guide the flow of your code.
Simple and Intuitive: Simplify complex programming concepts with a minimalistic approach, focusing on essential operations and structures.
Expandable and Customizable: Build upon the existing set of emojis and define your own functions and commands within the language.


Emoji Glossary
Each hand emoji in the language represents a specific command or operation:
```
👋 (Waving hand): PRINT (Outputs data to the console)
🖐️ (Raised hand): INPUT (Used to receive user input)
✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END (Terminates a program)
🤚 (Raised back of hand): RETURN (Returns a value from a function)
✊ (Raised fist): Variable (Used to represent variables in the language)
👊 (Oncoming fist): 0 (Binary representation)
☝️ (One raised finger): 1 (Binary representation)
🤛 (Left-facing fist): IF (Start of an IF condition block)
🤜 (Right-facing fist): THEN (Start of a THEN action block)
🙌 (Raising hands): LOOP (Start of a LOOP block)
👏 (Clapping hands): REPEAT (Repeatedly execute a block of code)
🙏 (Folded hands): Function (Defines a function)
👍 (Thumbs up): Increment (Increases the value of a variable by 1)
👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement (Decreases the value of a variable by 1)
👈 (Backhand index pointing left): Move to the previous command in the current line
👉 (Backhand index pointing right): Move to the next command in the current line
👆 (Backhand index pointing up): Move to the same command in the previous line
👇 (Backhand index pointing down): Move to the same command in the next line
✌️ (Victory salute): Quotation (Starts or ends a string of text)
🤞 (Crossed fingers): AND (Logical AND operator)
🤟 (Love-you gesture): OR (Logical OR operator)
🤘 (Sign of the horns): NOT (Logical NOT operator)
🤲 (Palms up together): , (Comma)
🖖👍 (Vulcan hand + Thumbs up): MORE THAN operator
🖖👎 (Vulcan hand + Thumbs down): LESS THAN operator
🖖👌 (Vulcan hand + OK Hand): EQUAL TO operator
```
With these emojis, you can create a multidimensional grid of commands and navigate through them using the directional hand emojis. This adds a new dimension to your programming language and makes it even more unique and engaging.

The directional emojis 👈, 👉, 👆, and 👇 are used to navigate through the code.
