## emoBASIC - an Emoji-only Programming Language

Welcome to emoBASIC, a unique and expressive programming language that utilizes hand gesture emojis to write code. With emoBASIC, you can explore the world of programming in an engaging and visually intuitive way. This language simplifies syntax by replacing traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it accessible to beginners and fun for experienced programmers. 

## Features

emoBASIC is a unique, expressive, and intuitive programming language that leverages the power of hand gesture emojis to write code. It replaces traditional alphanumeric characters with a set of hand gesture emojis, making it not only accessible to beginners but also enjoyable for experienced programmers.

The language embraces a multidimensional programming experience, using hand direction emojis to guide the flow of the code. This results in a unique multidimensional structure and format guide that adds a visual dimension to programming.

With a focus on simplifying complex programming concepts, emoBASIC adopts a minimalistic approach. It concentrates on essential operations and structures, making it easier for users to understand and use.

Despite its simplicity, emoBASIC is expandable and customizable. Users can build with the existing set of emojis and define their own functions and commands within the language.

While emoBASIC supports single-digit addition and subtraction per function. This design choice is to ensure the language can be understood quickly and to simplify logic systems for conversational use with humans.

In emoBASIC, numbers are stored as variables using binary representation, and no emoji strings are allowed as variables for readability. The language also uses directional emoji as wait logic, creating delays or pauses in the code execution based on each character as a unit of time.

In summary, emoBASIC is a simple, intuitive, and expressive programming language that uses emojis to make coding more accessible and fun.

Emoji Glossary
Each hand emoji in the language represents a specific command or operation:
```
🤙 (Call me hand): START - This emoji marks the beginning of a program. For example, 🤙 indicates the start of your code.

👋 (Waving hand): PRINT - This emoji is used to output data to the console. For example, 👋 "Hello, World!" would print "Hello, World!" to the console.

🖐️ (Raised hand): INPUT - This emoji is used to receive user input. For example, 🖐️ name would prompt the user to input their name.

✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END - This emoji terminates a program. For example, ✋ would indicate the end of your code.

🤚 (Raised back of hand): RETURN - This emoji returns a value from a function. For example, in a function that calculates the sum of two numbers, 🤚 sum would return the result.

✊ (Raised fist): Variable - This emoji is used to represent variables in the language. For example, ✊ x would represent a variable named 'x'.

👊 (Oncoming fist): 0 - This emoji is used for binary representation of the number 0.

☝️ (One raised finger): 1 - This emoji is used for binary representation of the number 1.

🙏 (Folded hands): Function - This emoji defines a function. For example, 🙏 calculateSum ✊ x ✊ y would define a function named 'calculateSum' with variables 'x' and 'y'.

👍 (Thumbs up): Increment - This emoji increases the value of a variable by 1. For example, 👍 ✊ x would increment the value of 'x' by 1.

👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement - This emoji decreases the value of a variable by 1. For example, 👎 ✊ x would decrement the value of 'x' by 1.

👈 (Backhand index pointing left): This emoji is used to move to the previous command in the current line.

👉 (Backhand index pointing right): This emoji is used to move to the next command in the current line.

👆 (Backhand index pointing up): This emoji is used to move to the same command in the previous line.

👇 (Backhand index pointing down): This emoji is used to move to the same command in the next line.

🤛 (Left-facing fist): LESS THAN operator - This emoji is used to compare if one value is less than another. For example, ✊ x 🤛 ✊ y would check if 'x' is less than 'y'.

🤜 (Right-facing fist): MORE THAN operator - This emoji is used to compare if one value is more than another. For example, ✊ x 🤜 ✊ y would check if 'x' is more than 'y'.

🖖 (Vulcan salute): EQUAL TO operator - This emoji is used to check if two values are equal. For example, ✊ x 🖖 ✊ y would check if 'x' is equal to 'y'.

🤞 (Crossed fingers): AND - This emoji is the logical AND operator. For example, ✊ x 🤞 ✊ y would check if both 'x' and 'y' are true.

🤟 (Love-you gesture): OR - This emoji is the logical OR operator. For example, ✊ x 🤟 ✊ y would checkif either 'x' or 'y' is true.

🤘 (Sign of the horns): NOT - This emoji is the logical NOT operator. For example, 🤘 ✊ x would check if 'x' is false.

🤲 (Palms up together): , (Comma) - This emoji is used as a comma in the language. For example, in a function with multiple parameters, 🤲 is used to separate them, like so: 🙏 calculateSum ✊ x 🤲 ✊ y.

👌 (OK hand): Assignment operator - This emoji assigns a value to a variable. For example, 👌 ✊ x ☝️ would assign the value 1 to the variable 'x'.

✌️ (Victory Hand): Variable State - This emoji is used to represent a specific state of a variable. For example, ✌️ ✊ x would represent the current state of the variable 'x'.
```
With these emojis, you can create a multidimensional grid of commands and navigate through them using the directional hand emojis. This adds a new dimension to your programming language and makes it even more unique and engaging.

The directional emojis 👈, 👉, 👆, and 👇 are used to navigate through the code.

```
🤙
👋Hello, World
✋
```
Explanation of the code:

The program starts with 🤙 (START).
The 👋 (Waving hand) emoji is used to print the text "Hello, World"
The program ends with ✋ (END).
When executed, this program will output:
Hello, World

emoBASIC:

```
🤙
👌 ✊ ☝️👊
👌 ✌️ ☝️
🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️
👋 ✊
✋
```
In this program, we're assigning the binary value 10 (☝️👊, which is 2 in decimal) to the variable ✊ and the value 1 (☝️) to the variable ✌️. Then we're checking if the value of ✊ is less than ✌️, and if it is, we're printing the value of ✊.

Communicating in person with emoBASIC

```
You: 🤙 (Start)
You: 👌 ✊ ☝️👊 (Assign binary 10 to variable ✊)
You: 👌 ✌️ ☝️ (Assign 1 to variable ✌️)
You: 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️ (If ✊ is less than ✌️)
You: 👋 ✊ (Print ✊)
You: ✋ (End)
```
In this conversation, you're using hand gestures to communicate the same program. You start the program with the 🤙 gesture, assign values to the variables with 👌 ✊ ☝️👊 and 👌 ✌️ ☝️, check if ✊ is less than ✌️ with 🤛 ✊ 🤜 ✌️, print ✊ with 👋 ✊, and end the program with ✋.

IRL emoBASIC opens up a whole new world of possibilities for visual, non-verbal communication about programming and logic. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, you can use IRL emoBASIC to make your conversations more engaging and visually intuitive.
