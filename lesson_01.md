### Example 1: Printing a Number

Let's start with a simple program that prints the number 1 to the console. In emoBASIC, the number 1 is represented by the one raised finger emoji ☝️.

The program will look like this:

```emoBASIC
🤙
👋☝️
✋
```

Let's break it down:
- 🤙 is the START command, indicating the start of our program.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs data to the console, followed by ☝️, which is the number 1.
- ✋ is the END command, indicating the end of our program.

When this program runs, it will print the number 1 to the console.

### Example 2: Incrementing a Variable

Next, let's create a program that increments a variable. In this case, we'll start with a variable set to 0, increment it by 1, and then print the result.

Here's how you could write this program in emoBASIC:

```emoBASIC
🤙
✊
👋✊
👍✊
👋✊
✋
```

Here's what each part of the program does:
- 🤙 is the START command, indicating the start of our program.
- ✊ creates a variable. By default, variables in emoBASIC start at 0.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs the current value of the variable (0 in this case), with ✊ referring to our variable.
- 👍 increments our variable by 1, with ✊ referring to our variable.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which now outputs the updated value of the variable (1), with ✊ referring to our variable.
- ✋ is the END command, indicating the end of our program.

When this program runs, it will print 0 and then 1 to the console.

I appreciate your patience and guidance. Let me know if you have any more questions or anything else you'd like to learn about emoBASIC!
