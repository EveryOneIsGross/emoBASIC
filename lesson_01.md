## Lesson 1: Introduction to emoBASIC

Welcome to your first lesson on emoBASIC, a unique programming language that uses hand gesture emojis to create an expressive, intuitive, and visually engaging coding experience!

### What is emoBASIC?

emoBASIC is a programming language that replaces the traditional alphanumeric characters used in most languages with hand gesture emojis. This approach simplifies the syntax and makes coding accessible to beginners and enjoyable for experienced programmers.

### The Basics of emoBASIC

In emoBASIC, each hand gesture emoji is associated with a specific command or operation. Here are a few of the key emojis and their corresponding operations:

- 🤙 (Call me hand): START (Beginning of a program)
- 👋 (Waving hand): PRINT (Outputs data to the console)
- ✋ (Raised hand, fingers splayed): END (Terminates a program)
- ✊ (Raised fist): Variable (Used to represent variables in the language)
- 👍 (Thumbs up): Increment (Increases the value of a variable by 1)
- 👎 (Thumbs down): Decrement (Decreases the value of a variable by 1)

Here's how we can use these emojis to write a basic program in emoBASIC.

### Example 1: Printing a Number

Let's start with a simple program that prints the number 1 to the console. In emoBASIC, the number 1 is represented by the one raised finger emoji ☝️.

The program will look like this:

```emoBASIC
🤙
👋☝️
✋
```

Let's break it down:
- 🤙 is the START command, indicating the start of our program.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs data to the console, followed by ☝️, which is the number 1.
- ✋ is the END command, indicating the end of our program.

When this program runs, it will print the number 1 to the console.

### Example 2: Incrementing a Variable

Next, let's create a program that increments a variable. In this case, we'll start with a variable set to 0, increment it by 1, and then print the result.

Here's how you could write this program in emoBASIC:

```emoBASIC
🤙
✊
👋✊
👍✊
👋✊
✋
```

Here's what each part of the program does:
- 🤙 is the START command, indicating the start of our program.
- ✊ creates a variable. By default, variables in emoBASIC start at 0.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs the current value of the variable (0 in this case), with ✊ referring to our variable.
- 👍 increments our variable by 1, with ✊ referring to our variable.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which now outputs the updated value of the variable (1), with ✊ referring to our variable.
- ✋ is the END command, indicating the end of our program.

When this program runs, it will print 0 and then 1 to the console.

### Lesson 2: User Input and Functions

### Example 1: Getting User Input

In emoBASIC, we use the 🖐️ emoji to take user input. Let's create a program that asks the user for a number and prints it.

```emoBASIC
🤙
🖐️
👋✊
✋
```

Here's how this works:
- 🤙 is the START command, marking the beginning of the program.
- 🖐️ is the INPUT command, which receives user input and stores it in a variable.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs the value of the variable to the console, with ✊ referring to our variable.
- ✋ is the END command, marking the end of the program.

When you run this program, it will wait for the user to input a number, store it in a variable, and print that number to the console.

### Example 2: Creating a Function

In emoBASIC, we can create functions using the 🙏 emoji. Let's write a function that increments a variable and then call that function.

```emoBASIC
🤙
✊
🙏
👍✊
🤚
🙏
👋✊
✋
```

This is what's happening in the program:
- 🤙 is the START command, marking the beginning of the program.
- ✊ creates a variable. Variables in emoBASIC default to 0.
- 🙏 begins the definition of a function.
- 👍 increment our variable by 1, with ✊ referring to our variable.
- 🤚 is the RETURN command, marking the end of the function and returning control back to the main program.
- 🙏 is used to call the function we defined earlier.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs the value of the variable to the console, with ✊ referring to our variable.
- ✋ is the END command, marking the end of the program.

When you run this program, it will define a function that increments a variable, call that function, and then print the value of the variable (which will be 1, since the function incremented it) to the console.

In this lesson, we've learned how to take user input and create functions in emoBASIC. These concepts are essential in creating more complex programs.

### Lesson 3: Conditionals and Looping

### Example 1: Using Conditionals

In emoBASIC, we can use the emojis 🤛 (LESS THAN operator), 🤜 (MORE THAN operator), and 🖖 (EQUAL TO operator) to create conditions. Let's write a simple program that compares two numbers and prints a message depending on the result.

```emoBASIC
🤙
✊☝️
✊✊
🤛✊✊
👋☝️
🖖✊✊
👋✊
✋
```

Here's what's happening in the program:
- 🤙 is the START command, marking the beginning of the program.
- ✊☝️ creates a variable and assigns it the value 1.
- ✊✊ creates another variable and assigns it the value 2.
- 🤛✊✊ checks if the first variable is less than the second one.
- 👋☝️ if the condition is true, it prints 1.
- 🖖✊✊ checks if the first variable is equal to the second one.
- 👋✊ if the condition is true, it prints the value of the first variable.
- ✋ is the END command, marking the end of the program.

### Example 2: Creating a Loop

In emoBASIC, we can create loops using the emojis 👈 (move to the previous command in the current line) and 👉 (move to the next command in the current line). Let's create a program that prints numbers from 1 to 5.

```emoBASIC
🤙
✊
👋✊
👍✊
🤜✊☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
👈👈👈
✋
```

Here's how it works:
- 🤙 is the START command, marking the beginning of the program.
- ✊ creates a variable. Variables in emoBASIC default to 0.
- 👋 is the PRINT command, which outputs the value of the variable to the console.
- 👍 increments our variable by 1.
- 🤜✊☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️ checks if the variable is less than 5.
- 👈👈👈 if the condition is true, it goes back three steps and repeats the loop.
- ✋ is the END command, marking the end of the program.

This program will print the numbers 1 to 5 to the console.

In this lesson, we've learned how to use conditionals and loops in emoBASIC, which are crucial for creating more complex and dynamic programs.
